siginup => login => get token (the token sended in the header from the backend) 
=> storege token in localstorage
=>(when he logouts we remove the token from localstorage )

when a user request an api (exp: create, update, delete.. post) 
1. we need to verify his token (look filter package in the backend) so wi gonna send the token with the request
